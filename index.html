<h1> Welcome to Calculator
</h1>
<p> We used the pygame package to make a calculator in Python. You can input up to 15 characters and make as many calculations at one time as you want. It is a super easy-to-use, reliable, and glitch-free calculator.  We started by creating the visuals using the package pygame: setting the colors, coordinates, and size of rectangles. Next, we began assigning numbers and operations to the different keys and coding the Python behind the math; this was done in another file, which we then imported into our main file. From there, we refined our design to accommodate multiple calculations simultaneously, making it more beneficial to the user.</p>
